# wordle-finder
Rust program to help find the wordle word

## Downloading
I provide pre-built binaries on the releases page. I do not test the Windows binary, but it may work.

## Building
First, install rust using your package manager or from https://www.rust-lang.org/. After you have rust installed, download or clone the repository and then run `cargo build --release` in the repository folder. The binary should then be found at `./target/release/wordle_finder` or `./target/release/wordle_finder.exe` if you're on Windows.
